# DirectAdmin for Homey

DirectAdmin is web hosting control panel software that lets you administer your website and hosting options using a
graphical, web-based interface.

You can manage an unlimited number of websites, email accounts, etc. using a DirectAdmin control panel. DirectAdmin
automates tasks so that web servers can be easily shared and give website owners a way to quickly set-up and manage
websites.

This app allows you to get various server- and domain details and statistics.

You also will be able to create flows based these statistics and more.

Homey will automatically refresh the data every 15 minutes.

**Important**

The refresh interval of the data shown for some statistics in the app, depends on how many times a day the stats tally
command is executed on the server. By default, this is once a day. Please contact your server administrator if you have
any questions about this.
