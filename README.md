# DirectAdmin for Homey

DirectAdmin is web hosting control panel software that lets you administer your web site and hosting options using a graphical, web-based interface.

You can manage an unlimited number of websites, email accounts, etc. using a DirectAdmin control panel. DirectAdmin automates tasks so that web servers can be easily shared and give web site owners a way to quickly set-up and manage web sites.

This app allows you to get various server- and domain details and statistics.

You also will be able to create flows based these statistics and more.

Homey will automatically refresh the data every 15 minutes.

**Important**

The refresh interval of the data shown for some statistics in the app, depends on how many times a day the stats tally command is executed on the server. By default this is once a day. Please contact your server administrator if you have any questions about this.
